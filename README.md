# TwitterCapybaraBOT
[@BiotecUnilaBOT](https://twitter.com/BiotecUnilaBOT) is a Twitter Bot, automatized by TwitterCapybaraBOT, that replies and retweet when it contains the  "BSc. Biotechnology - UNILA" (biotec/unila/foz do igua√ßu variations) mention. It might help find newer students or provide information for people interested to know about it.

This is a simple project/bot, I wanted to test some GitHub Actions options and learn the new updates from Twitter API v2. Plus I learned how to build a bot anyhow. ;D
